# LR_Delivery_Time_Prediction
Problem StatementObjectiveThis assignment will help you apply linear regression techniques to a real-world business scenario.By working through this exercise, you will gain hands-on experience in using regression analysis toidentify key relationships between variables, make data-driven predictions and extract actionablebusiness insights. You will also develop an understanding of how to interpret regression outputs,assess model performance and effectively communicate findings to support strategic decision-making.Business ValueThe growing demand for quick and efficient delivery in the logistics industry calls for the developmentof systems that can predict delivery times accurately. Porter, an intra-city logistics marketplace,services millions of customers daily, and optimising delivery times is crucial for improving operationalefficiency.The objective is to build a linear regression model that can perform the following:1. Predict the delivery time for an order based on various input features.2. Help optimise delivery operations by providing accurate time estimates.3. Support operational planning and resource management, allowing for more effective use ofdelivery partners.Dataset OverviewContextThe Porter Parcel Delivery Times data set provides details about orders placed through Porter. Thedata has information about the orders, such as item quantity and order amount; information aboutthe store, such as category, distance from customer and market ID; and operational information,such as the number of delivery partners.ContentThe dataset consists of multiple observations, each representing data for a specific order, with thefollowing key attributes:Column NameDescriptionmarket_idID of the market where the restaurant is located.created_atThe timestamp when the order was placed.actual_delivery_timeThe timestamp when the order was delivered.store_primary_categoryThe category of the restaurant (e.g., fast food or dine-in).order_protocolThe integer code indicating how the order was placed (e.g., viaPorter or call to restaurant).total_itemsThe total number of items in the order.subtotalThe total price of the order.num_distinct_itemsThe number of distinct items in the order.min_item_priceThe price of the cheapest item in the order.max_item_priceThe price of the most expensive item in the order
